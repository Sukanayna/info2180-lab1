        <h2>Sukanayna Hoo</h2>
        <p>I am a first generation student pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science and minoring in Political Science. 
                I love to play volleyball. I am involved in clubs such as UWI's Government society, Chess club, Computing 
                society and planning to join UWI's Volleyball team. I intend to finish second year strong, hoping it doesn't
                finish me first. I am interested in web development because I like the designing aspect and
                how different components work together using code. </p>
